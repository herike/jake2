Jake2 README
============

Jake2 is a port of the GPL'd Quake2 engine from id Software to Java. Jake2 is
distributed under the terms of the GPL (see LICENSE).

The port was done completely in Java. No native libraries are used for the
game functionality. We use the jogl Java OpenGL bindings for graphics rendering
and Java OpenAL (joal) for sound. Since 0.9.4 release, Jake2 comes with an lwjgl driver
as an alternative for the jogl/joal combination, which has been dropped in the JOGL2 port.

Jake2 is still under development. Send bug reports and feedback to jake2@bytonic.de.
In regards to the JOGL2 port, please use the JogAmp forum: http://forum.jogamp.org/.

Currently Jake2 supports Linux, Windows2000/XP and Mac OS X. The Jake2 dedicated
server runs on every Java supported plattform.
The JOGL2 port runs on all platforms supported by JogAmp, 
incl. embedded ARM devices w/ GNU/Linux (Pandaboard, Rasperry Pi, Android devices etc.).

requirements:
400 MHz CPU
Geforce2 MX or better graphics accelerator
at least JRE 1.6 to run Jake2
at least [open]JDK 1.6 to build Jake2 from source

JOGL2 Port
==========

JOGL Renderer can be set via 'vid_ref', i.e. '+set vid_ref jogles2'
  - jogles1 ES1 renderer, may use GL2ES1 w/ 'jogl_gl2es1 1'
  - jogles2 ES1 renderer, may use GL2ES2 w/ 'jogl_gl2es2 1'
  - joglgl2 GL2 renderer, maybe disabled w/ 'jogl_gl2 0'
  - jogldummy NOP GL renderer to measure performance w/o GL costs

Special GLProfile selection flags:
  - jogl_gl2    0  disable joglgl2, default enabled '1'
  - jogl_gl2es1 1  allow desktop GL2ES1 for jogles1 renderer, default disabled '0'
  - jogl_gl2es2 1  allow desktop GL2ES2 for jogles2 renderer, default disabled '0'

Special drawable surface flags:
  - jogl_rgb565 1  requesting a RGB565 surface, otherwise request default RGB888 surface

Installation
------------

from binary distribution:
- run the installer with "java -jar Jake2-0.9.5-install.jar"
- follow the instructions
- change to the installation directory
- run the game with Jake2.sh or Jake2.bat
- to run Jake2 with the lwjgl OpenGL/OpenAL driver use Jake2_lwjgl.sh 
  or Jake2_lwjgl.bat

build from source:
- unpack jake2src-version.tar.gz or jake2-version.zip
- set JAVA_HOME environment variable to Your JDK1.5 installation
- run "build.sh installer" or "build.bat installer" to build the installer

installation of Quake2 data:
- if Jake2 does not detect the Quake2 files on startup you have the choice
  to select a baseq2 directory of a Quake2 installation (demo or full version)
  or to download and install the Quake2 demo files

If you want to have the latest experimental features you can grab the latest
Jake2 sources from CVS.
- "cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jake2.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jake2 login"
- when askesd for password simply press the Enter key
- "cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@jake2.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jake2 co jake2"
- proceed with the build from source instructions
